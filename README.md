# swiss_system_for_OP-ED
Swiss system utility for sorting stuff by rank. It is close enough to shiki contest behaviour - participants divide in pairs and "play parties" in several rounds untill the winner is decided or the complete rating is built.

A Swiss-system tournament is a non-eliminating tournament format that features a set number of rounds of competition, but considerably fewer than that of a round-robin tournament. In a Swiss tournament, each competitor (team or individual) does not necessarily play all other entrants. Competitors meet one-on-one in each round and are paired using a set of rules designed to ensure that each competitor plays opponents with a similar running score, but not the same opponent more than once. The winner is the competitor with the highest aggregate points earned in all rounds. All competitors play in each round unless there is an odd number of players.
